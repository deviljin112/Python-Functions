# Functions

## What are functions

DRY = Don't Repeat yourself.
</br>

- Removes repeated code.
- Allows a function to handle data dynamically.
- Breaks down the code into managable / readable blocks.
- Improves efficiency as functions are stored in RAM therefore on another call will run from RAM rather than load the function again.
- Allows for ease of handling data and data manipulation.
</br>

```python
def name_of_function(input):
```

Input is not essential function can have no input
